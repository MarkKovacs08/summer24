<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="IMG_0833.jpg" width="240" height="300">
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>I was born in Hungary which is a small eastern european country thats know for making porcelin<br>
and their love of paprika and palinka. I moved to the US when i was 4 years old so the language came<br>
natural to me. I never stopped speaking Hungarian since my parents can really only speak Hungarian<br>
well.</p>
<h3>Personal Life</h3>

<p>I live in Staten Island and have a pretty cool dog named Oreo that can drive cars as seen in the<br>
photo above. My hobbies consist of outdoor walks with my fam Staten Island has alot of nice park, <br>
watching shows curretly watching breaking bad with my girlfriend, playing video games which I am curretly<br>
addicted to helldivers 2 which i have 230 hours on, and working out because you can never have to much gains.<br>
</p>
<h3>Future goals</h3>
<p>I wish to TA this upcoming semester so I plan on brushing up on some material on the classes<br>
that I would TA for. I would also like to get a summer job but my resume makes me look like a bum<br>
so that'll be a challlenge. For my goals after graduation I would like to work in a game development<br>
studio and if thats not possible then I would wanna make my own studio and make indie games as a side<br>
gig to wahtever job I do get. </p>
